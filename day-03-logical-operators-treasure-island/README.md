# Day 01 - Logical Operators - Treasure Island

## 🎯 Project Description
A text-based adventure game where the player makes choices to find treasure on a mysterious island. This project focuses on using logical operators (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to create different story paths.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Run the program: `python main.py`
2. Follow the story prompts
3. Make choices by typing your answers
4. Try to reach the treasure without meeting your doom!

## 🧠 Concepts Learned
- **Logical Operators**: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- **User Input**: `input()` function
- **String Methods**: `.lower()` for case-insensitive input
- **Conditional Logic**: Creating branching storylines
- **Code Structure**: Nested conditions

## 🔧 Key Features
- Multiple choice paths
- Case-insensitive input handling
- ASCII art for visual appeal
- Different endings based on user choices

## 🎨 Game Flow
```
Start → Choose direction (left/right)
  ↓
